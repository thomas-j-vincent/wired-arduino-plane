# code for a wired glider with two control points

This project is a relatively simple glider plane, controlled by only a single servo on each of the wings. 
The plane prioritises controlling the altitude over turning. 
In the first five seconds turn the potentiometers to the max and then the minimum to set a practical max/min to make the program more responsive.
I never actually made this, only simulated it so i dont know how well it works in practise. 

# Here is the simulation on tinkercad:
